# TODO
* Need a function to update a specific tile on the board
* Validation functions (both for valid tiles and valid moves)
* Functions to list valid moves for each peice

# THOUGHTS
* Maybe choose a different method for representing the board (Currently using a 2D List)
* Algorithm to generate possible moves for a piece?
* How to access the board given classic chess board labels
* How to access 2D list and update squares on the board
* Possibly use chess algebraic notation for player input?
